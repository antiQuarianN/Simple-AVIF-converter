# Foreword

I have often downloaded images in AVIF format, and it has always been a challenge to find an image converter. I found a good Chinese converter, but unfortunately it was lost, so it was decided to write just a Python script.

Images are converted to PNG format only!

# Installation

1) Install the required packages
  ```sh
  pip install pillow av
  ```
2) Run the script
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
3) Insert the path to the directory where the AVIF files are located. Example: `C:\Users\User\Downloads\Image`

4) PROFIT!

# Soon

1) Add a selection of the format you want to convert the image to. 

2) Add the option to convert the image to JPG format.
